# Learning Java
This repository contains exercises, explanations, notes developed based on the [Complete Java Course - Object-Oriented Programming + Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/?srsltid=AfmBOor14nRT5sp1sHdTBJcIekjZcpPGDS4cR6vX7PaktXu8lt0-m--) taught by Nelio Alves on Udemy.

Each folder represents a learning stage and will continue to be updated as the course progresses and as I keep learning.  

The purpose of this repository is to acquire knowledge and document my progress during the course, practice Git and GitHub and serve as review and reference material for the future.
