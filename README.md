# Learning Java
This repository contains exercises, explanations, notes developed based on the [Complete Java Course - Object-Oriented Programming + Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/?srsltid=AfmBOor14nRT5sp1sHdTBJcIekjZcpPGDS4cR6vX7PaktXu8lt0-m--) taught by Nelio Alves on Udemy.

Each folder represents a learning stage and will continue to be updated as the course progresses and as I keep learning.  

The purpose of this repository is to acquire knowledge and document my progress during the course, practice Git and GitHub and serve as review and reference material for the future.

- `2 - Object-Oriented Programming - Part1`  
  _In progress._  
  This file contains the introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is divided in the sections 8 (a), 9 (b), 10 (c) and 11 (d).    
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

  - `a - Introduction to OOP`  
    It is divided in 2 projects used as examples (a, b), exercises (c) and explanation/exercises about static members (d).
    <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>

    - `a - Project 1 - Triangle`  
      A project that calculates the area of 2 triangles, and tell which area is bigger.  
      It is divided in 3 parts...
        1. Without the use of OOP
        2. Including OOP
        3. Including Cohesion

      This project represents the first contact with the POO concepts in Java!  

    - `b - Project 2 - Stock`  
      Simple project simulating stock management where a product will have the data: name, price, and quantity in stock, and will include the operations of adding to and removing from stock.  
      This project also includes teaching the toString method.  
      Here are the first and second versions of this project (Initial structure with a `Product` class and basic operations. Inclusion of the `toString()` method for product information.).

    - `c - Exercises`  
      Three exercises to practice OOP.  
      1. `Rectangle` -> calculates the area, perimeter and diagonal of a rectangle, based on its sides.
      2. `Salary` -> calculates the salary of the employee based on a percentage of increase
      3. `Student aproved` -> calculates if a student was approved or not based on their grades.

    - `d - Static members`  
      Contains the explanation of static members and a exercise.  
    
  - `b - Constructor-this-overloading-encapsulation`  
    <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>

    - `a - Constructors`  
      Third version of the stock project explaining the use of constructors and the word _`this`_.  
    
    - `b - Overloading`   
      Fourth version of the stock project to explain overloading.  

    - `c - Extra_notes.md`  

    - `d - Encapsulation`  
      Fifth version of stock project including encapsulation and access modifiers.  
    
    - `e - Exercise bank-account`  
      Basic simulation of a bank account, demonstrating encapsulation, use of `this`, and good constructor practices.
    
  - `c - MemoryBehavior-arrays-lists`  
    <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>

    - `a - Reference-and-Value-Types - Memory-deallocation`  
    - `b - Vectors`  
      In `Project` we has 2 examples. The first register the height of X people and return the average. The second register X products and return the average price of them.  
      In `Exercises` there is:   
        - Exercise 1: It receives X numbers and return the negatives, the sum and average.
        - Exercise 2: It receives the name, age and height of X people and returns the average height and percentage of younger than 16 years old.
        - Exercise 3: It receives X numbers and return the heighest and the evens.
        - Exercise 4: It receives the values of 2 vectors (A and B) and, based on them, calculates the resultant vector.  
        - Exercise 5: It's a simulation where a hotel has 10 room (from 0 to 9) and they will be rented to X people. The program receives the name, email and room the person will rent and in the end, displays the rooms that are occupied.
    - `c - For-each`  
    - `d - Lists`  
      - `Explanations`  
        Contains the explanations and example about lists.
